VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist Chocolatey moderators and the community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

1. Upstream project and binaries

The EyeRest application and installer are developed and maintained by the
original author:

  Project: https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest
  License: MIT

The Windows installer used by this Chocolatey package is published by the
same author on the official GitHub Releases page.

2. Download location

The MSI installer is downloaded from the GitHub release assets:

  https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest/releases/download/v1.3.0/EyeRest-1.3.0-setup.msi

This is the same URL used in chocolateyinstall.ps1.

3. Checksum verification

To verify the integrity of the installer, compute the SHA256 checksum of the
downloaded MSI and compare it to the checksum specified in chocolateyinstall.ps1.

Example (PowerShell):

  PS> Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 'EyeRest-1.3.0-setup.msi'

The expected SHA256 checksum is:

  SHA256:  1C9BF2706B8459A4F6FDF11B3654F188C16EE322BD9EBEF2D62FA0E52D782EA9

(Replace INSERT_SHA256_CHECKSUM_HERE with the actual value used in
chocolateyinstall.ps1.)

4. Build / authorship notes

EyeRest is built from the source code in the repository above and the MSI
installer is produced and published by the same author (Necdet Şanlı).
There are no third-party repackaged binaries; this package simply automates
installation of the official MSI published on GitHub Releases.
