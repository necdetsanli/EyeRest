# Privacy Policy – EyeRest

_Last updated: 2025-12-03_

EyeRest is a small, open-source Windows tray application that helps you follow the “20–20–20 rule” for eye health by showing periodic desktop reminders.

This document explains what data EyeRest **does not** collect, what it **does** store locally (if you enable it), and how it behaves regarding your privacy.

---

## 1. General principles

- EyeRest is designed with a **privacy-first** approach.
- The application **does not collect, transmit, or sell** any personal data.
- There is **no telemetry**, no analytics, and no background network service.

All behavior is local to your machine.

---

## 2. Data collection

EyeRest **does not**:

- Collect your name, email, or any contact information.
- Track your browsing history, applications, files, or keystrokes.
- Log what you look at on screen or how you use your computer.
- Send any usage information to a remote server.

The app only shows notifications and updates its tray icon state based on your options.

---

## 3. Local settings and configuration

Depending on the version and your choices in the **Options** dialog, EyeRest may store some **non-personal settings** locally, such as:

- Whether reminders are enabled or disabled.
- The reminder interval in minutes.
- Whether left-click on the tray icon should toggle reminders.
- Whether the app should start automatically with Windows.

These values:

- Are stored **locally** (for example in a small configuration/INI file and/or in the registry for autostart).
- Do **not** contain personal or identifying information.
- Are used solely to restore your preferences on the next launch.

You can reset these settings at any time by:

- Changing options in the app, and/or  
- Removing the configuration file and disabling autostart via Windows settings.

---

## 4. Network activity

EyeRest does **not**:

- Connect to any remote server.
- Perform automatic update checks.
- Download or upload any data in the background.

Any network access you see related to EyeRest would only be indirect (for example, if Windows itself checks for toast notification services or Store updates).

---

## 5. Third-party libraries

EyeRest may use some third-party libraries (for example, for Windows toast notifications). These libraries are:

- Used **locally** within the application.
- Not used to send your personal data anywhere.

For details, you can review the project’s source code and dependencies:

- GitHub repository: https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest

---

## 6. Microsoft Store and external distributions

If you install EyeRest from the **Microsoft Store**, the Store may collect some generic installation/usage statistics according to Microsoft’s own policies.

- This data collection is handled by **Microsoft**, not by EyeRest.
- EyeRest itself does not add any extra telemetry or tracking beyond what the Store platform already does.

Please refer to Microsoft’s privacy policy for more information about Store-level data collection.

---

## 7. Open source transparency

EyeRest is open source. You can:

- Inspect the source code.
- Build the application yourself.
- Verify that there is no hidden telemetry or data collection.

## 8. Contact and questions

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy in EyeRest, you can:

- Open an issue on GitHub:  
  https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest/issues

I’m happy to clarify how the app works or adjust behavior if something could be made more privacy-friendly.
